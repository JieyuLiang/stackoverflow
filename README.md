## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How active are developers on Stack Overflow?
2. Is the developerâ€™s salary related to their activity on Stack Overflow?
3. Is the status of the user account related to user behavior? Can it be further utilized?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.`stack-overflow-developer-survey-2017.ipynb` The notebook has been exported to an html file.
The data is made up of two files: 
1. `survey_results_public.csv` - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. `survey_results_schema.csv` - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@l41498946/can-we-guess-that-developers-who-are-more-active-on-stackoverflow-earn-more-72d52fce94f6).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
